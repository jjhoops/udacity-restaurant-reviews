---
## Overview

This code covers Stage 1 of the Restaurant Reviews web application for the Mobile Web Specialist course from Udacity. It has the following features:

* A fully responsive layout
* Responsive images, both for sizing and art direction
* A restaurant listings page
* A restaurant info page
* Accessibility updates
* Service worker implementation to allow for viewing previously browsed pages while offline
* All other rubric requirements
## How to view

1. Start up a simple HTTP server from this folder to serve up the site fileslocally. Python is a simple option for this. In a terminal window, check to see if you have Python already installed by running `python -V`. If you don't have Python already, head to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

If you have Python 2.x, start the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`. For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`.

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000` and explore some restaurants.
3. In Chrome you can open the Console, go to Application / Service Workers, and then check the Offline option to see offline behavior.
